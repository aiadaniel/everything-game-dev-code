# Changelog

All notable changes to this scaffold should be documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Cost-confirmation gate and harness-native resolution order for AI asset generation. `manifests/asset-providers.json` gained `confirmOverUsd` (default $0.50), `nativeFirstCapabilities` (`image`, `skybox`), and per-capability `estCostUsd`; the schema enforces them. `scripts/generate-assets.js` now estimates each run's cost, prints it (including in `--dry-run`), and refuses runs at or above the threshold without `--yes` (or `ASSET_GEN_YES=1`; threshold overridable via `--confirm-over` / `ASSET_GEN_CONFIRM_OVER`) — so an agent must surface the cost and get confirmation before spending. Policy documented in `rules/common/asset-pipeline.md` (resolution order native→API→placeholder; confirm-before-spend), `/generate-assets`, the `ai-asset-generation` skill, `/full-game` (Phase 5 asks once before any spend and prefers the free native path for images), README, `.codex/README.md` (Codex `$imagegen` is the preferred image path), and the manifests/scripts READMEs.

### Changed
- AI asset generation is now documented everywhere as an OPTIONAL, capability-gated layer rather than a core path: it activates only when the provider API key is in the environment (`FAL_KEY` for fal.ai), and with no key the scaffold falls back to its built-in placeholder/procedural tooling and behaves exactly as before. Reframed across `rules/common/asset-pipeline.md` (new optional-capability + no-fabrication rules), `/generate-assets` (a "Capability Gate" section up top), the `ai-asset-generation` skill, `/full-game` Phase 5 (placeholders are the default; generation is an optional in-place upgrade when a key exists), `placeholder-asset-pipeline` (the default always-available path), root README ("AI Asset Generation (optional)"), `.env.example`, `manifests/asset-providers.json`, and `manifests/README.md`. `scripts/generate-assets.js` now reports the missing key as an unavailable optional capability and points back to the placeholder commands instead of a bare error.

### Added
- AI asset generation layer (engine-neutral): `manifests/asset-providers.json` + `schemas/asset-providers.schema.json` — the generative provider registry mirroring the `engines.json` pattern, with fal.ai as default provider (one pay-per-use key covers every modality) routing seven capabilities to current models (image: Nano Banana, skybox: equirectangular prompt contract, model3d: Tencent Hunyuan3D → GLB, sfx/speech: ElevenLabs, music: CassetteAI, video: Seedance/Kling/Veo)
- `scripts/generate-assets.js` — zero-dependency Node client for the fal.ai queue API: resolves capability→model from the registry, supports `--dry-run`/`--seed`/`--model`/`--input-json`, downloads results to a staging directory, and writes a `.provenance.json` sidecar (provider, model, prompt, seed, request id) per run
- `/generate-assets` command + `art-audio-content/ai-asset-generation` skill — entry point and execution depth for upgrading placeholder assets to generated content under the drop-in replacement contract, routing raster acceptance through `generated-raster-asset-pipeline` and engine import through the active engine layer only
- AI-Generated Asset Rules section in `rules/common/asset-pipeline.md`: registry-only model ids, engine-neutral staging, mandatory provenance (an asset without provenance is treated as unlicensed third-party content), env-var-only API keys, same acceptance gates as authored content, deliberate cost management
- `fal-media` optional MCP server in `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` for interactive model exploration and cost estimation (the script remains the reproducible path), and `FAL_KEY` documented in `.env.example`
- `samples/PrismDefense3DAssetsGen/` — live demo of the AI asset generation layer: a copy of the Visuals variant where every visual/audio asset was generated via `/generate-assets` + `scripts/generate-assets.js` against fal.ai (21:9 equirectangular aurora skybox, 3 seamless tileable textures, 7 Hunyuan3D GLB models through a concept-image → Rapid image-to-3D pipeline, 10 ElevenLabs SFX + CassetteAI music loop, nano-banana-pro menu key art, Seedance image-to-video intro cinematic behind the menu). GLBs upgrade the live `InstancedMesh` geometry/material asynchronously so instancing, damage tinting, and the flat-color fallback survive; every asset carries a `.provenance.json` sidecar and raster acceptances live in `generated-assets.json`. Gameplay/sim untouched (sim smoke still passes) per the no-retro-edit variant convention; deployed at `http://51.75.26.136/prism-defense-gen/` (own Caddy `handle_path` block — the original variants keep `/prism-defense/`). Second pass: towers turn toward their current target (view-side aim mirroring the sim's targeting rules, frost idles in a slow spin), and the flat terrain plane became a displaced-relief mesh dressed with three more generated props (crystal formations, spire trees, runed boulders) scattered as instanced rings around the board. Third pass: two selectable levels — `LEVELS` registry in the sim config (parameterized `buildPath`, `sim.reset(levelIndex)`) mirrored by per-level render themes (`setLevel`: board rebuild, texture/skybox/fog/light swap, prop-set visibility); level 2 "Mars Outpost" ships a longer zigzag path and a fully generated Martian asset set (skybox, 3 tileable textures, hoodoo spire + rock arch props); menu gained level select, pause/end screens gained a Main menu button
- `manifests/asset-providers.json` model-id fixes from the first live run: video default corrected to `fal-ai/bytedance/seedance/v1/pro/text-to-video` (the flat `fal-ai/seedance-1-0-pro` id does not exist; image-to-video and Seedance 2.0 listed as alternatives, Veo id corrected to `fal-ai/veo3`), and `scripts/generate-assets.js` no longer requires `--prompt` when `--input-json` carries the full request (image-to-3d endpoints take no text prompt)
- AI Asset Generation documented across user-facing surfaces: root README section + Quickstart row, Asset Generation Workflow (now workflow 9) in `docs/orchestration/workflow-sequences.md`, asset-generation sequence row in `docs/orchestration/README.md`, `/generate-assets` in the OpenCode command index (65 → 66), and the harness-neutral generation pointer in `.codex/README.md`

- `samples/PrismDefense3DVisuals/` — visuals variant of PrismDefense3D following the PirateInvadersImagesGen precedent (gameplay untouched, render layer only): CC0 ambientCG textures on board/path/terrain, gradient sky + fog, pulsing crystal glow; now the build served at `http://51.75.26.136/prism-defense/` (the original remains flat-color placeholder evidence)
- `samples/PrismDefense3D/` — first 3D sample (Claude Code harness, June 2026): a mobile-first Three.js tower defense generated by one `/full-game` run, exercising the web 3D layer end-to-end (`rules/web/rendering-3d.md` sim/render split with fixed-timestep interpolation, instanced flat-color primitive placeholders, procedural WebAudio, GPU-flat restarts) plus a headless sim smoke test; deployed at `http://51.75.26.136/prism-defense/` (served by Caddy — the VPS's per-game paths moved off host nginx in 2026-04)

### Fixed
- `skills/art-audio-content/README.md` had drifted from 0.4.0: the five common 3D skills (`3d-asset-pipeline`, `3d-animation-pipeline`, `rigging-skinning-pipeline`, `materials-shading-pipeline`, `lighting-lod-pipeline`) were missing from its index

## 0.4.0

### Added
- Engine layer registry (`manifests/engines.json` + schema): the single source of truth for which engine layers exist; `profile-resolution`, the engine-isolation test, and the engine-profile-guard hook now derive from it, and `validate:engines` enforces the per-engine structural contract (rules, skills, reviewer agent, commands, manifest entries) in both directions
- `npm run new:engine -- <id> [display]` — scaffolds a complete engine layer as a validation-passing TODO stub set (rules, 4 starter skills, reviewer agent, 4 commands, registry/manifest/doc wiring, harness wrappers); supports `--dry-run`; verified end-to-end against the full validate chain with a sandbox engine
- `npm run doctor` — installation diagnostics with PASS/WARN/FAIL and remediation hints: environment, git hook path, active profile, `.game-dev/` state consistency, harness adapters, generated-artifact drift, MCP placeholders
- `npm run sync:graph` / `validate:graph` — generated Mermaid dependency graph (`docs/orchestration/dependency-graph.md`) of command -> agent and command -> skill edges grouped by command-agent-map sections, plus an orphaned-skills report (16 orphans when introduced, closed to 0 later in this release); wired into the validate chain (closes the audit P5 visual-graph item)
- README count badges (agents/commands/skills/rules/contexts) are now regenerated by `sync:structure` from `git ls-files` and drift-checked by `validate:structure-artifacts`; `docs/structure-overview.md` counts now exclude READMEs so both surfaces agree (a `countMarkdownFiles` exclusion bug also counted top-level READMEs as content)
- Engine input parity skills: `godot/godot-input-patterns` (InputMap actions, propagation order, devices, rebinding, paused-tree input) and `unreal/unreal-enhanced-input` (Input Actions, Mapping Contexts, triggers/modifiers, runtime remapping, local multiplayer) — every engine layer now has a dedicated input skill, and `/input-review` names all four in its hand-off note
- `godot/godot-3d-scenes` skill: Node3D composition, camera rigs, physics body choice and collision layers/masks, WorldEnvironment ownership, and 3D density patterns (MultiMesh, visibility ranges) — closing the last per-engine 3D coverage gap; `/godot-review` and `/godot-scene-audit` route 3D projects through it
- Common 3D content layer: five engine-neutral skills (`3d-asset-pipeline`, `rigging-skinning-pipeline`, `3d-animation-pipeline`, `materials-shading-pipeline`, `lighting-lod-pipeline`) and the `/art-3d-pass` review command mirroring `/art-2d-pass` — the art-audio-content domain previously covered 2D only
- 3D placeholder primitives: `/unity-placeholders`, `/godot-placeholders`, and `/web-placeholders` now also generate procedural 3D primitives (box/sphere/capsule/plane) with flat-color materials under the same drop-in contract; the stale "Unity is the only engine with placeholder commands" note in `placeholder-asset-pipeline` was corrected (the remaining gap is Unreal only)
- Web 3D capability: new `rules/web/rendering-3d.md` (renderer choice incl. WebGL2 baseline/WebGPU enhancement, scene/camera/light conventions, glTF assets, GPU budgets, disposal ownership) and `web/web-3d-rendering` skill; `rendering-canvas`, `performance`, and `memory` web rules gained 3D-aware lines, `/web-review` + `/web-scene-audit` route 3D projects through the new skill, and the twelve "(HTML5/canvas)" identity descriptions across manifests, agents, commands, and indexes were widened to HTML5 with 2D-or-3D coverage
- Zero orphaned skills: the three engine reviewer agents now list their full skill packs (the root cause — web-reviewer already did, which is why web had no orphans), `cinematic-pipeline` joins technical-artist, `compliance-checklists` joins `/cert-check`, and `crash-triage` joins `/bug-triage`; `sync:graph` reports 0 orphans (was 16, audit P3 closed)

### Fixed
- `extractHeadingBullets` in `scripts/lib/validation.js` had a double-escaped regex (`\\s`) that never matched, silently turning the Required Skills / Uses These Skills / Related-references checks of `validate:structure` into no-ops; the references were verified clean once the check became real
- `install-modules.json` `rules-core` was missing `rules/web/**`, silently dropping web rules from baseline installs
- `engine-profile-guard` hook told users to activate "unity, unreal, or godot" — message now derives from the registry and includes web
- `manifests/README.md` counts and tables were stale (17 -> 18 components, 9 -> 10 profiles, missing web rows)
- Documentation sweep for stale pre-web and pre-0.3.0 content: root README badges (51 -> 64 commands, 86 -> 97 skills, 92 -> 114 rules), `PirateInvaders/` -> `samples/`, missing `rules/web/` and `/web-setup` mentions, engine-isolation policy docs, and the Claude/Codex/OpenCode adapter READMEs that still listed three engines

## 0.3.0

### Added
- Content-domain pass commands over previously command-less skills: `/localization-pass`, `/accessibility-pass`, `/animation-pass`, `/dialogue-design`, `/input-review`
- Two new design skills with entry points: `design/game-feel-design` + `/game-feel-pass` (feedback stacks, response timing, juice budgets) and `design/procgen-design` + `/procgen-design` (seeds, determinism, validation gates)
- Placeholder generation commands for the remaining 2D-capable engine layers: `/godot-placeholders` (EditorScript, ImageTexture, AudioStreamWAV PCM synthesis) and `/web-placeholders` (Canvas 2D sprites, Web Audio synthesis), mirroring the `/unity-placeholders` drop-in-replacement contract (Unreal deliberately deferred)
- Phase contexts now reference the new commands: production (animation/game-feel/input passes), preproduction (dialogue/procgen design), QA (accessibility/localization passes)

### Fixed
- `commands/README.md` index was missing `/context`, `/economy-balance`, `/ui-flow-review`, and the four web commands
- `.opencode/commands/README.md` listed a phantom `engine-review` command and omitted `context` and the web commands

## 0.2.0

### Added
- Web (HTML5/canvas) as a fourth engine layer: `rules/web/` (23 rule files), `skills/web/` (8 skills), `/web-setup` `/web-review` `/web-build-fix` `/web-scene-audit` commands, `web-reviewer` agent, `engine:web` component and `web-production` install profile
- Generated asset pipeline: 7 asset skills (sprite, tilemap, 2d-animation, ui-asset, ui-animation, placeholder, generated-raster) plus `validate:generated-assets`
- `/context` command to activate `contexts/` phase files; phase commands now reference their matching context
- `/full-game` samples: 9 complete web games (PirateInvaders ×2, Tetris2DMutation, LosRenacidos ×3, pacmanAI ×3) with conventions (`samples/CONVENTIONS.md`) and a harness comparison writeup
- Real validation layer: ajv JSON Schema validation (`validate:schemas`), two-way wrapper parity, generated-vs-committed drift checks, engine content-isolation test, skills index completeness check
- Generators as single source of truth: `sync:wrappers` (harness command wrappers + opencode.json from `commands/`), `sync:hook-wiring` (`.claude/settings.json` + `.cursor/hooks.json` from `hooks/hooks.json`), `sync:structure` (structure artifacts from `git ls-files`)
- Hook execution on Claude Code via `scripts/hooks/claude-adapter.js` (warn-only)
- Harness support tier matrix (`docs/harness-support.md`)
- OpenCode harness adapter parity with Claude and Codex

### Fixed
- CI green for the first time: structure artifacts are now derived from `git ls-files`, so local and CI output always match (gitignored content can no longer leak into committed artifacts)
- `/tdd` meant "Technical Design Document" on OpenCode and test-driven development everywhere else; unified to test-driven development
- Install pipeline re-documented as a resolver (nothing is copied); documented `--profile`/`--engine` invocations now work
- Schema/instance divergences reconciled (hooks, mcp-servers, package-manager); `mcp-servers.json` no longer points at the plugin schema
- Examples now teach the real manifest component vocabulary; `.env.example` documents only variables the tooling reads
- Engine- and harness-specific content removed from engine-neutral asset skills
- Test path resolution bug (all test files); tests are now discovered instead of hard-coded

## 0.1.0
- Initial public scaffold structure defined
- Core layers established for rules, agents, commands, skills, contexts, hooks, and harness adapters
- Engine isolation model established for Unity, Unreal, and Godot
